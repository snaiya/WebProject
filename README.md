And individual webpage for game 

Game 1 : Colour Guessing Game
------
The game contains two modules.
1)Easy
2)Hard

The basic idea of the game is:you have to guess the colour palette according to the the rgb code mentioned above.
In easy modudle there are 3 colours from which you have to select the correct colour acoording to rgb code.
In hard module there are 6 colours from which you have to select the correct colour according to rgb code.
There is a counter of 60 seconds. And at the end the score on the basis of the number of times correct colour selected is given.

Game 2: Bat hunt game
------- 

There is a bat which you have to shoot. The bats will be moving in around the window. And you have to select the target and shoot. Every bat you shoot the score will be increased. And if you miss the target the scores will be negated.
As the time in the counter increases the speed of the motion of the bat will increase too.
At the end of 60 seconds the score will be reflected.


This is just a basic model of all the games. And we intend to develop more. We wanted to try something in gaming on Web Developmennt instead of informative or social sites.
We have tried to learn all the objects property , events and animation of object in our game. We have tried learning the making of games using js from scratch.

Hope you enjoy.
Thank you.
